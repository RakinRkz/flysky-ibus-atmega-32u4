# flysky-ibus-leonardo
Decodes FlySky IBus data directly to an Arduino Leonardo USB Game Controller.

This sketch requires nothing other than:
1. iBus compatible RC receiver.
2. Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro (ATmega32u4 microcontroller).

There's **no** need for any software or virtual joysticks as it's all controlled by the microcontroller.
