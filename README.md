# flysky-ibus-leonardo
Decodes FlySky IBus data directly to an Arduino Leonardo USB Game Controller.

This sketch requires nothing other than:
1. iBus compatible RC receiver.
2. Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro 5v (ATmega32u4 microcontroller), connect the IBus to pin 10.

There's **no** need for any software or virtual joysticks as it's all controlled by the microcontroller.

This project is built using Visual Studio 2017 Community and Visual Micro (Arduino extension).
